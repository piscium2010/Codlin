# Lime - React UI parts

Lime is an extremly lightweight react-based UI kit for building UI components. It consists of a few essential thing like Collapsible, Layer, List, Ripple and Scroll, with which you can build your own UI component from scratch.


## Why lime?

U probably have seen a lot of UI libraries that is fully featured, API rich and powerful. Then comes a time that you need something a little bit different from the library and you are doomed. 

The fully featured component is also fully complex, hard to understand and customize. Well, good news is that Lime is stupid and dead simple. Instead of providing component we provide stories built with Lime to show you how to build a component yourself.
